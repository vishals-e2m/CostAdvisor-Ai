### NOTE: 
  - For production use, we need to enhance this implementation with additional intelligent logic. This current version serves as a reference point, and we plan to build upon it moving forward. Please share any smart logic or optimization ideas you may have so we can incorporate them and make the solution more robust, efficient, and production-ready.
